# Image Protection Guide

This document explains the comprehensive image protection system implemented on the ARY Photography website.

## Current Protection Issues

The current protection relies solely on JavaScript techniques that can be easily bypassed:

```css
img:not(.logo-image), video {
    -webkit-user-select: none;
    -moz-user-select: none;
    -ms-user-select: none;
    user-select: none;
    -webkit-user-drag: none;
    -khtml-user-drag: none;
    -moz-user-drag: none;
    -o-user-drag: none;
    user-drag: none;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

```javascript
document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
});
```

These methods can be bypassed by:
- Disabling JavaScript
- Using browser developer tools
- Using browser extensions
- Taking screenshots
- Directly accessing image URLs

## Implemented Solutions

We've implemented a multi-layered approach to protect images:

### 1. Server-Side Protection (.htaccess)

```apache
# Protect images from hotlinking
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\.)?aryphotography18\.com/ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$ - [F]

# Protect against image scraping
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*(bot|spider|crawler|scraper|wget|curl).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$ - [F,L]
```

This prevents:
- Hotlinking (embedding images on other sites)
- Automated scraping by bots
- Direct access to image files from other sites

### 2. Dynamic Watermarking

The `image-protection.js` script applies dynamic watermarks to images in the lightbox:

- Creates a canvas element
- Draws the image on the canvas
- Adds a semi-transparent watermark with copyright information
- Replaces the image source with the watermarked version

### 3. Custom Error Page

A custom error page (`image-protection-error.html`) is displayed when someone tries to access protected images directly or through hotlinking.

### 4. Invisible Overlay

An invisible overlay is added to portfolio images to prevent easy right-clicking and saving.

### 5. Security Headers

Additional HTTP headers are set to enhance protection:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
- `Content-Security-Policy` with strict settings

## Additional Recommendations

For complete protection, consider these additional steps:

1. **Low-Resolution Images**: Use lower resolution images on the website
2. **Visible Watermarks**: Add visible watermarks to original images
3. **EXIF Data**: Add copyright information to EXIF data
4. **Legal Notices**: Add clear copyright notices on the website
5. **Digital Fingerprinting**: Consider adding invisible digital fingerprints to track image usage

## Important Note

No protection system is 100% effective against determined users. These measures create reasonable barriers while maintaining a good user experience. The goal is to deter casual copying while allowing legitimate users to enjoy your photography.

## Implementation

All protection measures have been implemented without affecting the site's appearance or functionality. The protection works alongside existing code and enhances it rather than replacing it.
